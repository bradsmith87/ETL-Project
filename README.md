# ETL-Project

Lego sales

In this we have used data sets from Kaggle to do the analysis.
We are tring to find the availabality of products, parts details  using inventory detailes
based on the set_num.

We are clean the data sets using pandas functions  and cretaed the dataframes.

Once the data is sorted, loaded the data in to SQL data base using conntion engine from Pandas.

Once the data connected and uploded to database, we have used SQL quires to retrive the related data
to find the inventory of lego sets available in the warehouse.
